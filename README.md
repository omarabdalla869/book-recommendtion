ðŸ“š Book Recommendation System

"Find the right book for every reader â€“ powered by data, embeddings, and emotions!"

ðŸš€ Overview

This project builds a smart book recommendation system using:

7,000+ books metadata

Natural Language Processing (NLP) for semantic search

Emotion and category prediction to enhance recommendations

It goes beyond basic filtering by understanding what readers feel and want.

ðŸ—‚ Workflow
1. Data Acquisition

Dataset: 7k Books with Metadata

Loaded automatically using KaggleHub

import kagglehub
dataset_path = kagglehub.dataset_download("dylanjcastillo/7k-books-with-metadata")

2. Feature Engineering

Handled missing values (description)

Added new features like age_of_book

Prepared data for semantic search

books["missing_description"] = books["description"].isna().astype(int)
books["age_of_book"] = 2024 - books["published_year"]

3. Semantic Recommendations

Uses vector embeddings to find similar books

Example:

retrieve_semantic_recommendations("magic fantasy adventure", top_k=5)


Returns books with themes similar to the query.

4. Emotion & Category Analysis

Category Prediction: Fiction vs. Nonfiction

Emotion Detection: Understands emotional tone of a description

predict_category("A story about dragons and magic")  # Fiction
analyze_emotions("A scary haunted house story")      # {'fear': 0.87, ...}

5. Visualization & Insights

Missing data visualization

Publication year trends

Emotion distribution across books

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

Python: Data handling & ML

Pandas, NumPy: Data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn: Visualization

Transformers (HuggingFace): NLP for emotions & categories

ðŸ–¥ How to Run
git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation.git
cd book-recommendation
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook recommendation_book.ipynb

ðŸŒŸ Why This Project?

Traditional recommendations rely on ratings â€“ ours understands meaning & emotion.

Can be extended to:

Personalized recommendations

Integration into eBook platforms

Real-time user feedback

ðŸ›  Future Enhancements

Deploy as a Streamlit web app

Use state-of-the-art embeddings (e.g., OpenAI, SBERT)

Add user preference learning
